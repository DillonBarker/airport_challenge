# My Work-through

1. To begin I made a rough note of what I thought the user stories wanted,
I made a small table where I had objects and messages.

|  Object |    Messages    |
|---------|----------------|
|  Plane  | flying, landed |
|---------|----------------|
| Airport | land, takeoff, |
|         | full           |
|---------|----------------|
| Weather | stormy         |

2. I went through each user story one by one using TDD to build each method up
from the ground. The process went like:
identify what user story wants --> irb (what I would do) --> unit test (against
what I would do and what is the output) --> build method --> pass tests

3. After making the method and passing the tests, I would refactor these, incorporating
test doubles etc.
